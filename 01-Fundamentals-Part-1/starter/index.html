      /*
      Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

      1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
      2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

      TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

      HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
      HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰

      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
      */

      const tip15 = 1.15;
      const tip20 = 1.2;
      const bill = 40;

      console.log(
        bill >= 50 && bill <= 300
          ? `Bill: ${bill} Tip: ${bill * 0.15} Pay: ${bill * tip15}`
          : `Bill: ${bill} Tip: ${bill * 0.2} Pay: ${bill * tip20}`
